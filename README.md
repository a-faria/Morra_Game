Morra - Odds and Evens game


This project was made for a college assignment for the module: Software Development for Engineers.
“Morra” is a hand game usually played for entertainment or to settle a disagreement.
The aim is to develop a variation of this traditional game using Python and to follow the game rules and assignment requirements.

Created a program to allow a user to repeatedly play the game “Morra Odds and
Evens” with a computer. At the beginning of each game the user will be prompted to
choose whether s/he would like to be the “Odds” or “Evens” player. In each round of
the game the user must decide the number of fingers to show (i.e. between 1 and 10).
Similarly, in each round of the game the computer will randomly pick one number
between 1 and 10. These were the main rules it was also requested to meet a specific score system.

This was a group project of 2 students, (myself and my colleague Ana).


  
  Game rules: 
    * Choose between even and odds

    * Choose a number of fingers between 1 and 10

    * If the total is an odd number, odds win and vice versa

    * Winner of each round scores 2 points

    * Who chooses the closest number to the total fingers wins 1 extra point

    * The winner of the game is the first player to reach at least 6 points
